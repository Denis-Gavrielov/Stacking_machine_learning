Solving the Titanic Classification Problem Using the Stacking Method

I am personally enjoying following data science competitions on Kaggle. I am currently completing the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity which provides me with a fantastic mathematical and practical introduction to the most important machine learning algorithms. I found it interesting how lecturers in the Nanodegree emphasise applying a single best algorithm for a given problem to find an accurate solution. In contrast, professionals in data science competitions use Stacking to build complex models with many different underlying machine learning algorithms. Through Stacking, accuracy is maximised in practice.

In this notebook I will not attempt to replicate one of those highly complex solutions. Instead, I will solve the Titanic classification problem found on Kaggle by first using various machine learning algorithms by themselves and later using a simple Stacking model. Finally, I will verify whether a Stacking solution gives the highest accuracy over single algorithms.

The description, data set, and evaluation criteria for the problem can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.

For this project I am using Python 3 and its most popular libraries for Data Science including pandas and numpy. I am using seaborn and matplotlib for data visualisation and scikit-learn and xgboost for machine learning.
